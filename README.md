# DSP Experiments

This repository contains a collections of my experiments on the topic of Digital Signal Processing (DSP), some of them can be tried out on [RedPitaya hardware](https://redpitaya.com/stemlab-125-14/).

- [**redpitaya-bode-analyser-alternatives.ipynb**](./redpitaya-bode-analyser-alternatives.ipynb) - Article provides descriptions of two alternative approaches to the default Bode Analyser web tool that comes with RedPitaya, namely "Impulse Response in Frequency Domain" and "Transfer Function of a Chirp Signal".
